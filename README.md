## EMOJISHOWER
- Emoji Finder is a simple **react app** that is used to find what the name of the entered emoji is.
- It simply inputs an emoji from the user and then finds what the name of the given emoji is.
- This application is using an API to do so. The API is returning a json object containing name and other characteristics of the emoji.
- Grabbing the data from the API, I used the api to grab the name and character of the emoji.
- And then used React useState to update the name of the emoji in the result.
